 * Given an array of strings, find if the given strings can be chained to form a circle.
 * A string X can be put before another string Y in circle if the last character of X is
 * same as first character of Y.
 *
 * http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/given-array-strings-find-strings-can-chained-form-circle/
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * Input: arr[] = {"geek", "king"}
 * Output: Yes, the given strings can be chained.
 * Note that the last character of first string is same
 * as first character of second string and vice versa is
 * also true.
 *
 * Input: arr[] = {"for", "geek", "rig", "kaf"}
 * Output: Yes, the given strings can be chained.
 * The strings can be chained as "for", "rig", "geek"
 * and "kaf"
 *
 * Input: arr[] = {"aab", "bac", "aaa", "cda"}
 * Output: Yes, the given strings can be chained.
 * The strings can be chained as "aaa", "aab", "bac"
 * and "cda"
 *
 * Input: arr[] = {"aaa", "bbb", "baa", "aab"};
 * Output: Yes, the given strings can be chained.
 * The strings can be chained as "aaa", "aab", "bbb"
 * and "baa"
 *
 * Input: arr[] = {"aaa"};
 * Output: Yes
