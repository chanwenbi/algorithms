/**
 * Fisherâ€“Yates shuffle Algorithm
 *
 * works in O(n) time complexity. The assumption here is,
 * we are given a function rand() that generates random number in O(1) time.
 * The idea is to start from the last element, swap it with a randomly selected
 * element from the whole array (including last). Now consider the array from 0
 * to n-2 (size reduced by 1), and repeat the process till we hit the first element.
 * O(n) complexity.
